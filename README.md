## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It took me some time to get this one right. Getting the markup right was a challenge, since this component has a lot of atomic elements with their own styles. I made it more complex by trying to achieve the responsive layout for the component without using media queries. It was a challenge. I ended up using media queries for spacing and font-size.

### Continued development

I will start my next project with a proper font-size and spacing scale set up as css variables. It makes the stylesheet more managable and easy to navigate.
